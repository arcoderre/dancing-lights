A sketch for an Arduino with a 5x8 NeoPixel shield

My daughter was enamored by a light display on a building downtown, so I've built one of her very own! In a nutshell, it's an Arduino clone with a 5x8 NeoPixel LED array shield on it, with a simple 3D-printed cover that vaguely resembles a building.

It's intended as a passive device that sits on a shelf looking pretty. It scrolls repeatedly over a number of display functions that I intend to keep expanding and/or modifying as requested by my "client" :)
